           like Angular, Vue.js, React or Polymer. It is also support working with the native iOS, Android mobile 
           applications.

           WebdriverIO is for anyone who wants to create simple web and mobile platform tests and have them run on 
           a range of browsers. There are even a simple tutorial with documentation that helps user to understand 
           which allign with their politics that the "software should be attainable for everyone who is curious".
           
           1.3 Intended Usage
           WebdriverIO lets you to write in an asynchronous manner, which can be useful in eliminating race situations 
           for the user.
